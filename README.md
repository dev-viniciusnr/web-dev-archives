# Web Dev Archives

This repository contains a collection of web development projects I built during my early learning journey.  
Most of these projects were created as practice while I was studying **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, exploring the foundations of front-end development.

They reflect my progress in understanding how to structure pages, style elements, and add interactivity using web technologies.

> These archives represent the beginning of my experience in building for the web â€” simple, raw, and full of learning.
